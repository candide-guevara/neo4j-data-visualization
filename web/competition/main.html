	<h1>Competion chord diagram</h1>
	
	<p>This diagram shows the main OnDs per airline by adding all the fligths for the same OnD during the whole year.
	Each colored ARC represents an airport. They are sized according to the number of arriving+departing fligths.
	Each colored CHORD represents the number of flights for a same airline and OnD.</p>
	
	<p>By hovering over a colored ARC you will highlight all the fligths arriving or departing from that airport.
	By hovering over a colored CHORD you will highlight all the fligths for that OnD among all airlines. Note that
	the table next to the graph will get updated to display all the airlines competing on that route and their price.</p>
	
	<p><strong>For example</strong>, by hovering over the colored ARC corresponding to airport LHR you can discover 
	that AY and	BA are competing for the HEL-LHR OnD.</p>
